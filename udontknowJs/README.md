# Getting Started with JavaScript, v2

## Kyle Simpson
### You Don't Know JS

* Want to learn to code using JavaScript? This is a great place to start! In this course, you’ll start out with a tour of the basic building blocks programming like variables, loops, functions and operations. Then, you’ll go through the three main pillars of JavaScript: Types and Coercion for comparing values and converting between types, Scope and Closure for knowing where variables can be accessed, and JavaScript’s “this” and Prototype system for dynamic context.

This course and others like it are available as part of the [Frontend Masters video subscription](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-javascript-v2/).
